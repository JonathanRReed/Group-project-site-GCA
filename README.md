# American Eagle Outfitters – Landing Page Redesign

A welcoming, authentic landing page redesign for American Eagle Outfitters, built with only HTML and CSS, focused on repairing trust and clarity following recent ad backlash.

## What’s Included

- **Landing page**: `index.html` with semantic sections
- **Stylesheet**: `styles.css` with modern, responsive CSS
- **No JavaScript**: Pure HTML/CSS only

## Trust-First Approach

This page emphasizes transparency, respect, and accountability:

- **Listening first**: Customer and community feedback informs changes
- **Clear standards**: Strengthened creative guidelines around respect and inclusion
- **Independent review**: External review for cultural sensitivity on major campaigns
- **Community investment**: Support for youth and community programs

## Sections

- **Header & Navigation**: Clean, accessible links
- **Hero**: Plain-language message acknowledging feedback and intent to improve
- **Trust & Values**: Concrete steps forward (cards)
- **Why Shop With Us**: Quality, shipping/returns, support, heritage
- **Featured Collections**: Three product categories (placeholders)
- **Community**: Simple social proof stats
- **About**: Brand promise stated plainly
- **Footer**: Standard informational links

## Running Locally

Open the page directly in a browser:

```bash

```

## File Structure

```text
.
├── index.html
├── styles.css
└── README.md
```

## Design Notes

- **Tone**: Authentic and calm. No slang, no emojis, no "vibe-coded" elements
- **Color**: Grounded blues and greens; clear contrast for readability
- **Layout**: CSS Grid and Flexbox; responsive breakpoints at 992px and 640px
- **Accessibility**: Semantic headings, descriptive link text, no decorative emoji
